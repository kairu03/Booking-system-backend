# 📌 Booking System Backend

[![Backend CI](https://github.com/kairu03/Booking-system-backend/actions/workflows/ci-backend.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/kairu03/Booking-system-backend/actions/workflows/ci-backend.yml)

A scalable RESTful Booking System API built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication**, engineered for real-world performance, security, and maintainability.

Implements production-grade backend practices including role-based access control, modular service architecture, centralized error handling, robust request validation, rate limiting, and automated testing with parallel execution to optimize test performance, alongside CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.

## 🔑 Authentication Flow

1. User registers with name, email, and password.
2. Password is securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
3. Upon successful login, the server generates a signed JWT containing the user ID and role.
4. The client includes the token in the request header: Authorization: `Bearer <token>`
5. Authentication middleware verifies the token signature and:
  - Extracts the user ID and role from the payload
  - Validates the user exists in the database
  - Attaches the authenticated user to req.user
6. Protected routes enforce role-based access control:
  - Admin users can manage categories, resources, and bookings
  - Regular users can only access and manage their own bookings
7. Authorization logic ensures:
  - Users cannot modify or cancel other users’ bookings
  - Admins can access and manage resources belonging to all users

---

## 📅 Booking Flow

1. A user selects a **resource** under a specific category.
2. The system retrieves the resource details and availability.
3. The user submits a booking request with:
  - selected `resourceId`
  - `startDate`
  - `endDate`
4. The backend validates the request:
  - Ensures the resource exists and is active
  - Validates that `startDate < endDate`
  - Checks for **overlapping bookings** to prevent scheduling conflicts
5. If validation passes:
  - A booking record is created with status `pending` (the default status)
  - The booking is linked to the authenticated user
6. Authorization rules are enforced:
  - Users can only view, cancel, or manage their own bookings
  - Admins can view all bookings and update booking status
7. Cancellation logic:
  - Users may cancel their own bookings
  - Admins can cancel or manage any booking

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**:
User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored, protecting sensitive credentials in case of data breaches.

- **JWT Authentication**:
Authentication tokens are signed using a secret stored in environment variables and verified on every protected request to ensure request integrity.

- **Role-Based Authorization (RBAC)**:
Access to critical operations is restricted based on user roles:
  - Admins can manage categories, resources, and bookings
  - Users can only manage their own bookings

- **Ownership & Access Control**:
Authorization checks ensure users cannot access, modify, or cancel bookings that do not belong to them, while admins retain elevated permissions.

- **Rate Limiting**:
Rate limiting is applied to sensitive endpoints (e.g., authentication and booking) to mitigate brute-force and abuse attacks.

- **Request Validation**:
All incoming requests are validated using Joi to prevent malformed or malicious data from entering the system.

- **Centralized Error Handling**:
Errors are handled through a global middleware to standardize responses and avoid leaking internal implementation details.

- **Environment Variable Protection**:
Sensitive configurations (e.g., JWT secrets, database URIs) are stored in `.env` files and excluded from version control.

- **Test Environment Isolation**:
Automated tests run using an in-memory database to ensure isolation from development and production data.

## ⚠️ Error Handling
- **Custom `ApiError` Class**
Standardizes error creation with status codes and messages for consistent handling across the application.

- **Async Handler Wrapper**
Eliminates repetitive try-catch blocks by automatically catching rejected promises in async controllers.

- **Global Error Middleware**
Centralized error handler that processes all errors and sends structured responses to the client.

- **Validation Error Handling**
Request validation errors (from Joi) are properly caught and returned with meaningful messages.
Consistent Error Response Format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message here"
}
```
